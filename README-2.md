I built this machine learning project from end to end to get some hands on practice of completing a clinical machine learning prediction study from start to finish. 
After completing dozens of online courses on the fundamentals of python and machine learning this project was the perfect step to bring what I had learnt together into one project. 


Prerequisites: Python 3.6 

Deployment:

I will be deploying this prediction model with cloud, to further learn about deploying ML models so others can use the model without having programming knowledge. This is a inherently important skill to have in my repertoire.

Built With: Azure notebooks.
